# UCS01 Cosmwasm Transfer Demo

This example demonstrates how to create a CosmWasm contract that calls Unionâ€™s UCS01 Relay to execute a cross-chain asset transfer.

Follow the guide at [docs.union.build/integrations/ucs01/cosmwasm](https://docs.union.build/integrations/ucs01/cosmwasm)

### Initial setup, ensure `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is installed

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Build the contract

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=mvp -C opt-level=z' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --lib --release -Z build-std=std,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort
```
